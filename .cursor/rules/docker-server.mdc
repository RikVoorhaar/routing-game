The routing server is located in ./routing_server. Whenever modifying this file, consider the contents of the docker compose
[docker-compose.yml](mdc:routing_server/docker-compose.yml), then run `docker compose build`. Look at log outputs of the build. If the build is unsuccessful, fix it and try again.

When ready restart the docker container using `docker compose down; docker compose up -d` to restart the docker container. Wait 30 seconds, and then tail the docker logs.
